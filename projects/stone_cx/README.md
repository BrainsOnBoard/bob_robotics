# Stone et al. Model of path integration
Published model of Bee path integration, re-implemented using sigmoid units in GeNN. Not configured for GPU simulation so build using the following steps:
* Build using CMake. If you don't have an NVIDIA GPU, build with the following option: ``cmake -DGENN_CPU_ONLY=on ..``

Outward path for both robot models is controlled using joystick device. Pressing 1st button (A on Xbox360 controller) starts homing and 2nd button (B on Xbox360 controller) stops model.
