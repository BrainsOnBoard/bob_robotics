# BoB robotics examples
This folder contains example projects covering most of the capabilites of BoB robotics.

On Linux, the examples can be built by running:
```
cd /path/to/example
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 6
```

Then to run you use:
```
./nameOfExample
```

Old method:

```sh
cd examples
./build_all.sh
```

Windows users can build the examples with the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in this
folder.
